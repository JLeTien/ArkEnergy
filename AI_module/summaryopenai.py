      'content': 'Licences have been granted or offered for six potential wind projects to be located off Gippsland.The licences mean that detailed assessment work to determine feasibility, including environmental studies and management plans, can now be commenced for the six regional projects.Consultation with First Nations groups, communities, and marine users are expected to continue throughout the feasibility licence process.If feasibility is proven, developers can apply for a commercial licence to build an offshore wind project to generate electricity commercially.The projects include:The Victorian Government said that it intends to grant another six licences, subject to First Nations consultation, including:The 12 projects could generate up to 25GW of electricity, which is more electricity that the entire state of Victoria generated in 2023.The proposed projects could create over 15,000 jobs during construction and another 7,500 ongoing jobs.Federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, said that Australia’s offshore wind industry presents a huge opportunity for the regions that have powered Australia for generations.“Australia’s first offshore wind zone has hit a new milestone, with reliable renewables and secure jobs a step closer for Gippsland.“Granting feasibility licences is the next step to helping deliver a new clean energy industry for Australia, as well as future proof energy security and reliability for Victoria.“I’ve awarded feasibility licences to projects that would bring the most rewards for Gippsland, its workforce and for our energy security.”Victorian Minister for Energy and Resources, Lily D’Ambrosio, said projects in the Gippsland offshore wind zone will be key to delivering the state’s renewable energy transition and meeting targets of at least 2GW of offshore wind energy generation by 2032, 4GW by 2035 and 9GW by 2040.“We’re proud to be paving the way for the country’s first offshore wind farms which will harness our world class offshore wind resources and power homes and businesses across Australia with renewable energy.“These offshore wind projects will also support thousands of jobs in Gippsland and across the supply chain – opening up new opportunities for skills development within the renewable energy industry.”Image credit: fokke baarssen/Shutterstock.com.'}, {'title': 'AEMC unveils proposal to improve NEM congestion management', 'content': 'The proposed reforms are designed to provide greater clarity to investors about where new renewable generation and storage projects should be located.The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has published a consultation paper proposing improvements to the way congestion is managed in the national electricity market (NEM), designed to help to keep system costs down for consumers and support jurisdictional renewable energy zones.The policy is set out in a consultation paper for stakeholder feedback, following a request by energy ministers to carry on the work of the former Energy Security Board (ESB) in progressing the detailed design of transmission access reform.AEMC Chair, Anna Collyer, said the hybrid model approach to transmission access reform – initially proposed by stakeholders – is designed to address the challenges posed by the rapid growth of renewable energy and storage projects in the NEM.”By 2050, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasts a seven-fold increase in grid-scale wind and solar capacity and a 19-fold increase in storage capacity.“As we transition towards a weather-dependent energy system and implement initiatives such as renewable energy zones, the Capacity Investment Scheme and Rewiring the Nation, it is crucial to carefully manage congestion to minimise the costs of the transition.“Our proposed reforms aim to ensure that the right projects are built in the right locations, generating at the right times, benefiting both industry and household consumers.‘’Currently, access arrangements in the NEM are not well suited to a future grid dominated by variable renewables and storage.‘’The arrangements are not designed to support the efficient management of congestion in operational timeframes, and, in investment timeframes they contribute to inefficiency and risk due to cannibalisation. This occurs when a new entrant displaces pre-existing generators instead of adding usable new electricity generation to the power system.”Without reforms to transmission access these risks and inefficiencies will increase as the transition to net zero progresses, increasing costs to consumers,” Ms Collyer said.The AEMC’s hybrid model builds on reform work carried out by the ESB in consultation with investors, renewable developers, consumer groups and other stakeholders.The model has two components:By integrating these components, the proposed reform aims to improve both operational efficiency and investment efficiency as well as managing access risk and incentivising congestion relief.The AEMC invites stakeholders to provide feedback on the consultation paper by Thursday 6 June, 2024. The AEMC will consider all submissions in developing its final recommendations to energy ministers to support the efficient and cost-effective transition to a renewable energy future.Image: https://www.shutterstock.com/g/Blackboard'}, {'title': 'Access rights declared for two NSW REZs', 'content': 'Applications for access rights for the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) have now opened.Solar, wind and battery projects in two New South Wales REZs will be given new opportunities to connect to the energy grid under access schemes being opened by the New South Wales Government.Access rights give greater certainty to investors and energy projects, and are designed to help coordinate and accelerate the delivery of renewable energy to power New South Wales.The government said access rights give confidence to investors and host communities by setting a limit on the amount of electricity generation and number of storage projects which can connect to network infrastructure in REZs.In a first for New South Wales, applications for access rights have now opened for the Central-West Orana REZ near Dubbo.The Energy Corporation of New South Wales (EnergyCo) will allocate initial rights to get new renewable energy to households and businesses.The New South Wales Government has also declared an access scheme for the South West REZ near Hay. Projects will be able to bid for access rights as part of a tender run by AEMO Services commencing in Q2 2024.Solar, wind and battery projects which gain access rights will pay a fee, and a portion will go towards providing community and employment benefits in these two REZs.To fast-track these benefits, the government has previously announced an initial $128 million in community benefits over four years for the Central-West Orana REZ, to ensure benefits flow before construction of new transmission and renewable generation projects commence. Community benefits for other zones, including South West, will be established soon.New South Wales Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Penny Sharpe, said, “This is another important step in delivering the REZs that will power New South Wales into the future. It is the first-time access rights are being offered in New South Wales REZs, marking a significant milestone for the Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.“Access schemes for the Central-West Orana and South West REZs will ensure we make the best use of new transmission lines, to reduce bills for energy consumers, improve planning outcomes for host communities and deliver new local, secure jobs.“Directing part of the access fee back into host communities will ensure residents and businesses see tangible benefits well into the future, in addition to low-cost power and a more diversified economy,” Ms Sharpe said.Image: https://www.shutterstock.com/g/HelloRF+Zcool'}]
